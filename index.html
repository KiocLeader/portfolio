		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>My name is Joshua Frey. I compete at the amature level for cross country and track. I have been running since joining the cross country team in 7th grade. My goal is to become the fastest guy running at Brigham Young University. I train every day and average about 70 miles. I also am studying Computer Science at BYU. I enjoy programming and am trying to find projects that I can create that will benifit other runners in the area.</p>
