		<ul>
			<li><p><strong>Lottery Name Selector</strong></p></li>
		</ul>
		<p>This project I created to help my wife with selecting the winner of the different raffels that she put on for her business. It takes any number of names, along with how many entries the person gets, and randomly selects one of them and announces the winner</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p><strong>Family History App</strong></p></li>
		</ul>
		<p>This was an android app that I created the front and backend for. It can store users, their family, events for each person, and then displays them on a google map. In the app you are able to edit what people appear on the map and the types of relation lines that it draws.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p><strong>Champion World Game</strong></p></li>
		</ul>
		<p>This is a game that I am currently working on creating. It is an offshot of chess where you are able to cast spells, summon more pieces, and level up your army.</p>
